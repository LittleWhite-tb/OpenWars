 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * OpenAWars is a open project trying to recreate the feeling of the game "Advance Wars" (by Nintendo).
 * This project is using C++ with SDL (SDL, SDL_image).
 * The project tends to be as possible portable and these following platforms should be supported: Windows, Mac, Linux, GP32X, AmigaOS4.
 * Finally, the aim is to have a game highly customisable
 *
 * \section editor_sec Game
 *
 * This documentation is about the Game part of the whole OpenAWars project.
 * The game has actually two game states. The game itself and the editor (from where you can create maps).
 * All the graphics and tiles/units settings are loaded from XML files. This brings the possibility to easely customise the game. More needs to be done.
