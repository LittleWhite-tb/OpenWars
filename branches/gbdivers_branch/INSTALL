Dependencies:

You need the SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf in development version to compile the OpenAWars_Editor

To generate the Makefiles needed to compile the project, you have to type:
aclocal
autoconf
automake --add-missing

To compile, you have to follow the normal procedure:
./configure
make

Actually you have to move the executables in the main folder (since I didn't fix my makefiles):
cp Sources/OpenAWars .
cp Sources/OpenAWars_Editor .

And you can run :)
